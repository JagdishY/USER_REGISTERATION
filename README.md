Project Title: User Registration System with Spring Boot, JSP, JPA, and Oracle Database
Description:
This project implements a User Registration System using the following technologies:

Spring Boot: For building the backend RESTful services and handling business logic.
JSP (JavaServer Pages): For rendering the user interface with dynamic content.
JPA (Java Persistence API): For interacting with the database and managing entity relationships.
Oracle Database: For storing user registration data and handling persistence.
Features:
User Registration:

Users can register by providing essential details such as name, email, password, and other required fields.
The system validates input data (e.g., email format, password strength) before accepting the registration.
Database Integration:

User data is stored in an Oracle Database using JPA (Java Persistence API).
The user information is mapped to an entity class, and CRUD operations are performed to save and retrieve data from the database.
Frontend with JSP:

The user interface is built using JSP pages that render dynamically based on user interactions.
Registration form with proper validation, error messages, and success notification on successful registration.
Backend with Spring Boot:

A Spring Boot backend handles HTTP requests, performs business logic, and communicates with the database.
The application uses Spring Data JPA for seamless interaction with the Oracle database and Spring Security for basic security features (optional).
Form Validation:

Server-side validation ensures that all user input is valid before saving it into the database.
Client-side validation (JavaScript) can also be implemented for a better user experience.
Security (Optional):

Passwords are stored securely using encryption (e.g., bcrypt).
User authentication and authorization mechanisms can be added if required.
Error Handling:

Appropriate error messages are displayed in case of incorrect input, system errors, or database issues.
Technologies Used:
Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA
Frontend: JSP (JavaServer Pages)
Database: Oracle Database
Tools: Maven for dependency management, Spring Security (optional)
